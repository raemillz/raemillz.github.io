I've always tended to lean towards what's comfortable in my life. I grew up in San Diego, CA, only a few blocks from the beach, where it would rarely get below 70*, in a house that my family built specifically for ourselves, that had a white picket fence and a golden retreiver in the front yard. When my parents wanted me to join an after-school program, I started playing water polo because I was already great at swimming, treading water, and throwing things. When I got to high school and had to choose electives, I chose aquatics, art, Spanish, and marine biology because those were all subjects that I already had a background in. This pattern went on through my college career at San Diego State University (hardly 45 minutes from my childhood home) where I majored in International Business with an emphasis on Spanish, and played NCAA women's water polo for four years. I was sucessful, comfortable, and incredibly predictable.

It wasn't until about a year after graduating from college that I realized that doing what was comfortable didn't necessarily mean that I was doing my best. While this may seem far too obvious to be an epiphany to many, it was a completely foreign concept to me at the time. One day while I was on the phone with my mom, she threw a very disruptive pearl of wisdom into the perfectly calm pond that was my life. She asked me if I was happy, I responded with a very perplexed "yeah, of course, why?", and she told me that she was worried that I was "existing, and not living."

Since that phone call, my mom's voice has echoed in my mind whenever I feel myself becoming complacent, urging me to move in the direction of the uncomfortable. Piece by piece, I have been building a life that I am truly excited to live.  The moment before deciding to apply for a Kode with Klossy scholarship, I was at my job in account management and sales, and realized that during the working hours of 9am-6pm, I was just existing, waiting until 6pm when I could leave that building and start living my life again. In that moment I decided to completely switch gears and follow a path that equally intruiged and scared me.

The decision to learn to code put life back into my career path and gave me a new horizon to look forward to, one that continually changes with each new language and goal. I'm learning new skills, challenging myself, and can proudly and sincerly report to my mom at the end of every day that I have not just existed, but truly lived.
