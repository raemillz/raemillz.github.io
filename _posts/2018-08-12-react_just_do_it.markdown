Recently, I was given a code challenge as the next step in the interview process with a company I am really excited to have the opportunity to interview with. The guidelines were as followed: 

Build a simple web page that lets you search for recipes using this simple recipe API: (http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/) 

Requirements: 
		●  A responsive landing page with a search bar. The user should get a list of results as she types (no extra buttons). The page should work on both web and mobile.  
		●  We don’t want to spam the recipe API, so we should send a request only when the user has stopped typing
