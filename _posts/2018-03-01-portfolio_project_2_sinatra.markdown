Woot woot! I just finished up recording the walkthrough for my second portfolio project in the Flatiron curriculum, and it was so satifying! This project went by much faster than my last, but there was still plenty of uncertainty when it came to creating something completely from scratch.

The app that I made was a vitamin tracker (inspired by care/of, if you're familiar), which allows a user to create a profile, build their own personal vitamin packs, and then add vitamins to those packs. It is in no way as beautiful or fun as the care/of app that it is based off of, but I created it all on my own, and am therefore very proud of it! 

What surprised me most about the process of this project compared to the last was how comfortable I have become with running into errors and debugging my program. During my last project, I had no coding background other that what I had acquired during my time with Flatiron; during this process, my confidence was so much higher and that helps a tremendous amount. Knowing that I have created an app before, ran into errors, and solved those errors on my own really sped up the process of this project. I also think that the difference in difficulty is in large part due to the fact that with coding, there is so much groundwork to cover before I even felt the slightest bit confident in my knowledge. After I completed the last project, I feel that I have a secure base of knowledge to work off of and create new and more compex apps as I progress.

In the future, when I get to the point that I want to refine my portfolio, I'm sure that I will revisit this app to refracture the code and make it more impressive. However, as of now I would love for  you to check it out at my github page or video walkthrough (links below).
